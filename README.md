# Project Review
Use the GitHub web interface to add a file named requirements.txt (exactly!) and click commit to save the file. In the most basic version of the Module 5 project, we may only need packages from the Python Standard Library - and those already included in the PyShiny Playground environment. If working in the browser, you likely won't need requirements.txt at all for this project. However, very few real applications do NOT need a requirements.txt file, so I'd say keep it around and use it as needed. If you work on the project locally (on your machine), you will need to requirements.txt and install various packages into your local project virtual environment. This is very common in real-world Python and great practice. 

Use the GitHub web interface to add a new empty file named app.py (exactly!)  and click commit to save the file. 

Verify your project repo has all 4 files:

README.md
.gitignore
requirements.txt
app.py (OR dashboard/app.py if working locally and deploying to GitHub pages - see more below).
If you decide to try the local development, you'll be able to deploy your live date site using GitHub Pages. To make it easy to build our app from a folder and export the app into the docs folder (for Pages), please move your app.py file into a folder. I named my folder "dashboard", so I have a dashboard/app.py file and no app.py in the root folder. This is a more common organization for Python projects. 

Your code is safely stored in the cloud - you can copy from it (and improve it) as you work through this module and complete Project 5.  

Use the README.md to keep your notes as you work.
